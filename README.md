LittleBlazors.Components is a small component library I've implemented as I found need for such components in different applications.
At the moment, there are only two component libraries in here:
- [Charts](https://github.com/mkArtak/LittleBlazors/wiki/Charts-control)
- [Wizard](https://github.com/mkArtak/LittleBlazors/wiki/Wizard-control)

Click on each page link to learn more about each component.
If you find some missing functionality, which you'd like to see implemented, let me know and I will consider implementing it.
