LittleBlazors.Components is a small component library I've implemented as I found need for such components in different applications.
At the moment, there are only two component libraries in here:

<table>
  
 </table>
| --- | --- |
| Component | Package |
| [Charts](https://github.com/mkArtak/LittleBlazors/wiki/Charts-control) | N/A |
| [Wizard](https://github.com/mkArtak/LittleBlazors/wiki/Wizard-control) | <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/LittleBlazors.Components.Wizards/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/LittleBlazors.Components.Wizards?logo=nuget&amp;style=flat-square" alt="Nuget"></a>|

Click on each page link to learn more about each component.
If you find some missing functionality, which you'd like to see implemented, let me know and I will consider implementing it.
